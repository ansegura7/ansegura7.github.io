Free hands-on course with the implementation (in Python) and description of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and techniques.

Although it is not intended to have the formal rigor of a book, we tried to be as faithful as possible to the original algorithms and methods, only adding variants, when these were necessary for didactic purposes.

### Examples:
1. NLP with spaCy
2. Semantic Enrichment of Entities
3. Spell Checker/Corrector
4. Word Embedding with Gensim
5. Relationship between Words
