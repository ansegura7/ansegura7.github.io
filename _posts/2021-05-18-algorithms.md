Free hands-on course with the implementation (in Python) and description of several computational, mathematical and statistical algorithms.

Although it is not intended to have the formal rigor of a book, we tried to be as faithful as possible to the original algorithms and methods, only adding variants, when these were necessary for didactic purposes.

### Algorithm
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
