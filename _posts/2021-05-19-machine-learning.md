Free hands-on and interactive course in Python, which starting from Data Science offers examples (in Google Colab) and explanation (in Twitter threads) on concepts and techniques of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP.

Although it is not intended to have the formal rigor of a book, we tried to be as faithful as possible to the original algorithms and methods, only adding variants, when these were necessary for didactic purposes.
