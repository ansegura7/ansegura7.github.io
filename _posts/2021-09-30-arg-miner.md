This repository contains a simple but efficient implementation of an argument-based recommender system, that makes use of the built taxonomy and lexicon to extract argument graphs from citizen proposals and debates of an e-participation platform. 

Paper presented at <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2960/">Joint Workshop of the 3rd Edition of Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) and the 5th Edition of Recommendation in Complex Environments (ComplexRec)</a> co-located with 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2021). Virtual Event, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, September 25, 2021.
